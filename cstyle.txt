File layout
	.c source files
		#include "filename.h"											| Single include + newline
		#define (global) private macros									| In UPPERCASE; see annex 1.1
		Const public global variables									| In UPPERCASE
		Public global variables											| Trailing _
		Const private global variables									| static + UPPERCASE
		Private global variables										| static + trailing _
		Private function prototypes										| static + prefix_camelCase
		Function declarations (public then private)						| In prefix_camelCase; see annex 1.2

	.h header files
		Include guard													| Prefer #ifndef
		#include dependencies											| System, usflib, program
		#define public macros											| In UPPERCASE; see annex 1.1

		typedef types													| camelCase for user-defined types
		extern global variables											| Trailing _
		Public function prototypes (global scope)						| prefix_camelCase

Annex - Further specification
	1.0 - Comments
		Always use multiline (/* ... */) comments, never // ...

	1.1 - Macros
		Macros are always in UPPERCASE.
		Macro arguments should be prefixed with an underscore.
		Local macros which take arguments should be prefixed with an underscore.
		Local macros should be #undef'd when they are no longer used.

	1.2 - Functions
		Functions are in prefix_camelCase, with prefix being the namespace.
		Parameter names should be the same in the prototype and the implementation.
		Functions should begin with a documentation comment ("docstring") followed by a newline.

	1.3 - Variables
		Global variables must end with a trailing _
		Constant variables are in UPPERCASE.
		Typedefs and tags of user-defined types are in PascalCase.
		Local variables are in camelCase, but prefer lowercase when possible.

	1.4 - Types
		Always use exact-width integer and floating point types.
		Do not use C99 bool types; use a signed 32-bit integer instead.
		Sizes and counts should be represented by a 64-bit unsigned integer.
		Prefer 64 bits over 32.
		Prefer unsigned over signed.

	1.5 - Declarations
		Do not declare and initialize variables in one statement, except for compound literals, globals & statics
		Declare variables close to their first usage.
		Prefer assignment inside expressions unless it harms readability.

	1.6 - Blocks
		'{' is on same line, while '}' is on its own line.
		Omit blocks in the case of a single, short expression. (e.g. if(cond) return 0;)

	1.7 - Whitespace
		Breaking expressions onto multiple lines add one to the indentation level.
		Macros and preprocessor directives start at indentation level 0.
		Pointer types have the '*' star character adjacent to the variable name. (e.g. u64 *arraysz;)
		Casts should have a space between the type and the castee. (e.g. (f32) (xoffset))

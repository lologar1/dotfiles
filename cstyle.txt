lzg's C coding style (updated 2026-01-14)

Project structure
	README
	Makefile (or other build tools)
	src/
		.c source files
	include/
		.h header files
	obj/
		.o object files

File layout
	.c source files
		#include "$@.h"
		Public global variables
		Private global variables
		Private function prototypes (limited to this file's scope)
		Function declarations (same order as their prototypes)

	.h header files
		Include guard
		#include dependencies
		#define macros
		typedef types
		extern global variables
		Public function prototypes (global scope)

C syntax (C23)
	Always use /* ... */ comments, never // ...
	Prefer #ifndef-style include guards
	Function prototypes' parameters should match the names in their implementation

	Always use exact-width integer and floating point types
	Use <inttypes.h> print macros for printing these types
	Do not use C99 bool types, use signed integers instead

	Do not declare and initialize variables on the same line, except for compound literals
	Prefer declaring variables immediately prior to their usage
	Prefer assigning inside expressions unless it becomes hard to understand

	'{' on same line, while '}' is on own line
	Prefer to omit blocks (and merge everything on one line) in the case of a single, short expression

	Breaking expressions on multiple lines adds one to the indentation level
	Macroes and preprocessor directives always start at indentation level 0

	Pointer types have the star ('*') adjacent to the variable name.
	Casts should have a space between the type and the castee.

	Typedefs are in CamelCase
	Functions are in snake_case, with the first word being the namespace
	Macroes are in MACRO_CASE, and should be undef'd as soon as their lifetime ends to avoid pollution.
